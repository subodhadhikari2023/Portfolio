- About
    - I am a backend-focused full stack web developer based in Kalimpong, West Bengal, India with strong experience in building Java-based web applications and RESTful APIs using Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate/JPA, and relational databases.
    - My work includes academic and government-aligned projects involving role-based access control, secure authentication, database-driven systems, and workflow automation. I focus on writing maintainable code, designing clear APIs, and understanding system behavior beyond surface-level implementation.
    - While Spring Boot remains my strongest skill, I am actively expanding toward modern frontend development (React) and Python-based automation, aligning my skill set with current freelance and industry requirements.
